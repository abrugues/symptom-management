# symptom-management
This repository contains the implementation of the capstone project for
the Mobile Cloud Computing with Android (MoCCA)] specialization on
Coursera, which doesn't exist anymore.

The project consists on a software solution to manage the symptoms of
head and neck cancer patients. Two main components are used to achieve
this goal: an Android application and a Spring based server.

The Android application is used by the patients to report their symptoms,
and by the doctors to check the status of their patients. The Spring
server mediates the interactions between patients and doctors.

A complete list of the requirements for each component can be found [here][1].
